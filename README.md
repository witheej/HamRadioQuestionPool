# HamRadioQuestionPools
JSON format of the question pools used for Amateur Radio licensing exams administered by the National Conference of Volunteer Examiner Coordinators. Data was parsed from documents posted on http://www.ncvec.org/.

# Intro

An **Element**, in FCC terms, essentially refers to an exam required for licensing.

Each question pool is divided into 10 **Sub-Elements**.

Each Sub-Element is divided into 1-8 **Sub-Topics**.

Each Sub-Topic consists of 10-19 questions. 

Exams are generated by randomly selecting one question from each Sub-Topic in a question pool (resulting in 35 questions for Technician Class and General Class exams, and 50 questions for Amateur Extra Class exams).
